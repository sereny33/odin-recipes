    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chef John's steak frites recipe features a pan-seared and pan-sauced
      steak, just like you'd get at a French bistro. If you always grill steak,
      this will be a game-changer. This method delivers a perfectly prepared,
      perfectly seasoned steak, and can be used with many different cuts beyond
      New York strip.
