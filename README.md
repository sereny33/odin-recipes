# odin-recipes

This is a basic recipe website project for TOP curriculum.

Each recipe page should include:

1. An image of the finished dish.

2. An appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.

3. An “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.

4. A “Steps” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.
